------------

### Issues

All changes made to PriceFeed.info should be discussed on GitHub's Issues.

### Working on Issues

If you want to work on an issue, create a new branch and create a pull request and link it to an issue by, e.g.,

```
Resolves #1234.
```

The title of a pull request should start with "[WIP]" indicating you are working on it.

If you finish coding, remove the "[WIP]" prefix and mention to the maintainers for code reviews.

Maintainers will merge the PR if it is acceptable.

DO NOT push your changes to the `main` branch directly.
